## Quick start

For the contribution to open source projects, a few simple steps must be followed that work the successful interaction between developers and an organized work flow; The steps to follow are detailed below.

Several quick start options are available:

1.Fork of the source repository:
- To do this, go to your github account.
- Locate the repository in which you are going to collaborate.
- In the upper right corner, locate the fork icon and click on it.
- This makes an exact copy of the repository in the profile of the contributing user. <br/>

2.Clone the repository:
- Once the Fork is made, the forked repository must be cloned, with the following
- Command: git clone https://github.com/afleones/Ecommerce.git <br/>

3.Enter the cloned folder: <br/>

  cd Ecommerce<br/>
 
4.Check connections to remote sources: <br/>

  git remote -v 

5.Add a remote connection to the original repository: <br/>

- git remote add upstream https://github.com/afleones/Ecommerce.git (forked) <br/>

6.Optional, rename the remote connection. In order to avoid confusion, in the previous step a local connection was created with the original repository named upstream, this name   can be changed to a more personalized one with the following command: git remote rename origin fork

We already have a copy of the original repository, now we will work on the daily workflow.
